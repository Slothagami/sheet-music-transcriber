# Sheet Music Transcriber

### TODO
- generate sheet music with VexFlow
    - make sure the beginning notes are recorded
    - analyze MIDI to indentify the note types (whole, quarter, eighth, etc.)
    - Organise midi in terms of beats, not time (based on first note start time)
    - Generate vexflow svg and open it in a new tab to be saved 
		- include space for title, and live adjust settings to make it look better
