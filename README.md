# Sheet Music Transcriber

### TODO
- generate sheet music with VexFlow
    - make sure the beginning notes are recorded
    - analyze MIDI to indentify the note types (whole, quarter, eighth, etc.)
    - Organise midi in terms of beats, not time (based on first note start time)
    - generate sheet music
      - generate multiple pages
        - title on first page
        - page numbers
      - download button (svg or pdf option)
        - convert to pdf
      - add bass clef staves
