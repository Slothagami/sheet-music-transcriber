### TODO
- process video
  - make sure the beginning notes are recorded
  - Organise midi in terms of beats, not time (based on first note start time)
  - analyze MIDI to indentify the note types (whole, quarter, eighth, etc.)
- generate sheet music with VexFlow
  - generate multiple pages
  - voices for bass staves
  - download (svg or pdf option)
    - convert to pdf
